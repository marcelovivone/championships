Hello! I'm ready to continue working on the Championships. Please review the following key project files to get a complete picture of the current status, architecture, and environment:

Environment configuration:
- docker-compose.yml (in the root directory)

Backend
- backend/package.json (for the installed modules)
- backend/.env (for global configuration)
- backend/src/db/schema.ts (for the database structure)
- backend/src/app.module.ts (for the overall module architecture)
- backend/src/main.ts (for global configuration)

Frontend
- frontend/package.json (for the installed modules)
- frontend/README_FRONTEND.md

After you've analyzed these, let me know you're ready, and we can proceed with the next task from the next steps. We can consult the implementation historic, the work to be done and the next steps accessing the PROJECT_REVIEW.ts.

Along the development/implementation is must keep the PROJECT_REVIEW.ts uptodate.

Very important, see section Next Steps in the PROJECT_REVIEW.ts.

Remember, you are a senior software engineer.
